## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

### 1\. Setup

The setup section should guide new users on how to get the project running on their local machine.

#### **Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

  * **Node.js**: Next.js requires Node.js v18.18.0 or later.
  * **Git**: Git is essential for cloning the repository and managing versions.

#### **Getting Started**

Follow these steps to get the development environment up and running:

1.  **Clone the repository**: Use the `git clone` command followed by your repository URL to download the project files.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**: Move into the newly created folder.

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**: Install all the necessary packages listed in `package.json`.

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables**: If your project uses environment variables (e.g., API keys), create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the required variables. You can typically find a template file like `.env.example` to guide you.

    ```bash
    # .env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```

-----

### 2\. Running the Application

This section explains how to run the Next.js application in different modes.

#### **Development Server** 🏃‍♂️

To start the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### **Production Build**

To create an optimized production build of your application, run the build script:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```

#### **Production Server**

After building the application, you can start the production server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

-----

### 3\. Deployment

This part covers how to deploy the application to a live server. For most Next.js projects, **Vercel** is the recommended and easiest deployment platform, as it was created by the same team behind Next.js.

#### **Deploying with Vercel**

1.  **Create a Vercel account**: Sign up for a free Vercel account and connect it with your GitHub account.
2.  **Import your project**: From the Vercel dashboard, click "Add New..." \> "Project" and select your Next.js repository from GitHub.
3.  **Configure settings**: Vercel will automatically detect that it's a Next.js project and set up the build and deployment settings for you. You can add any necessary environment variables here.
4.  **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application every time you push new changes to the main branch.

#### **Other Deployment Options**

Next.js applications can also be deployed to other platforms that support Node.js or static hosting. Common options include:

  * **Node.js Server**: You can deploy to any provider that supports Node.js, such as **Render** or **DigitalOcean**.
  * **Static Export**: For applications that don't use server-side features, you can generate a static HTML/CSS/JS export and host it on any static web server or a service like **GitHub Pages** or **Netlify**.
